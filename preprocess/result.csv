"While he'd made a fuss about Dev answering for him, in reality it had been a spur of the moment decision.",他对Dev擅自替自己回答的事小题大做了一番，但那不过是一时冲动。,105,32
"Because when Artie offered the pen, he remembered that seeing things always became easier when he was high.",因为当Artie拿出笔的时候，他回想起了自己在兴奋时更容易看到‘东西’。,107,36
"It wasn't really a positive part of being high, but if he's going to be doing this psychic shit, maybe he should experiment more with it?",他并非替嗑药辩解，只不过为了通灵，他一心想着多做些实验。,137,28

"He was always on other stuff whenever he smoked weed, after all.",不过，毕竟他每次抽大麻都会配别的药。,64,18
"Opioids, stimulants, dissociatives, and definitely hallucinogens like shrooms did the trick, but for obvious reasons, he's never going to try those things again.",阿片类药物、兴奋剂、游离药品，当然还有致幻菇这样的迷幻药，它们统统脱不了干系。但出于某些显而易见的原因，他再也没有碰那些东西的打算了。,161,67
